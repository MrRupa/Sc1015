## About our project
The project of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (SC1015) using stroke dataset in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) to explore and predict the occurence of stroke using attributes from dataset and models

### 1.  Problem Formulation
Our DataSet: Stroke Prediction Dataset | Kaggle 
Our Question: 
- Can we predict stroke based on the attributes in dataset
- Which models would perform best in predicting the occurrence of having stroke
